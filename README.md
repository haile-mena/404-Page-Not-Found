## Overview

This project is a single page, responsive website that displays a mock '404 Not Found' page with a return to homepage button. The site can be view differently based on whether the viewer was on desktop or mobile. This challenege was a fun way to apply what I learned so far about HTML and CSS. I've learned a lot about researching CSS, importing fonts, displays and improved in creating a cohesive website overall.
